# Simple Implementation of dynamic array/vector

*still a work in progress*

Basic implementation of dynamic vector which is intended to allow user provide desired growth factor and type of data to be stored in the vector. Based on the type of data the vector will optimize fetches, writes and sorts.

- Version 1 (current) : Basic functionality, constructors, iterators, accessors
- Version 2 : Add utility functions for searching, sorting, adding elements based on index, replacing elements and calculating performance
- Version 3 : Add way to fine tune the type of vector (types yet to finalize), corresponding optimizations based on vector type
- Version 4 : 
- Version 5 : Performance enhancements
